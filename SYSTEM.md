# System Engineering Document
This document outlines some basic systems engineering information for the project. 

## Objectives

0. Assist Robotics Engineers with visualizing common robotics abstractions in a quick and intuitive way

1. Visualize robotic abstractions
	1. Visualize static and dynamic pose, coordinate transforms in real time
	2. Visualize objects that the user provides (meshes, textures)
	3. Visualizations should be performant and run well

2. Provide an expressive API so that users can interact with the visualizations and extract meaning
	1. Make it easy for people to interact with Vobo
	2. Offer useful abstrations for software engineers in Python & C++

3. Serve as an educational tool for roboticists
	1. In the field of robotics
	2. In the field of computer graphics
